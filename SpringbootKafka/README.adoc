= Getting Started

== Reference Documentation

This is a POC about the integration between Kafka and Spring Boot.

=== Docker Compose file: contains the following components:

. Kafka
. Zookeeper

This project has a producer and a consumer both for Kafka.

To be able to simulate the producer and consumer behaviors a REST endpoint was created for that purposes.

=== How it works?

Run the docker-compose file and wait until all the components to be ready, Kafka will the listening the 29092 port, then run the Springboot application.

After that the */send* endpoint will be waiting for the *POST* calls.

Example: `http://localhost:8080/send?message=Hello_World`
